##  Next-Level Ideas

Building this out could get nerdy in a satisfying way:

- **Tag and filter system** (Unity, C#, Tools…)  
- **Search box** for fast lookup  
- **Dark mode** because wide-bright is so 2008  
- **Live hosting badge or README screenshot** for flair  
- Potential future: fetch tips from a JSON or `.md` instead of hard-coded
