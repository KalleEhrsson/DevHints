##  What’s Inside

- **Unity Inspector & Scripting Attributes Cheat Sheet**  
  A digestible reference for all those handy `[SerializeField]`, `[Range]`, `[RequireComponent]`, and even DOTS and interop attributes:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}.

- **C# tricks & useful developer links**  
  More tips and links to come, systematically organized—or maybe whimsically. Your call.

##  Project Layout

- `index.html` — the UI that serves up your DevHints  
- `style.css` — look and feel—kept tidy  
- `script.js` — light interactivity, like showing/hiding categories  
- `Usefull_Sites.txt` — your growing stash of dev resources

##  Why It’s Worthwhile

-  A quick Unity and C# attributes reference at your fingertips  
-  Self-updating as you learn—add hints, expand categories  
-  Unpretentious and zero-config—open the site, learn something

##  Next-Level Ideas

Building this out could get nerdy in a satisfying way:

- **Tag and filter system** (Unity, C#, Tools…)  
- **Search box** for fast lookup  
- **Dark mode** because wide-bright is so 2008  
- **Live hosting badge or README screenshot** for flair  
- Potential future: fetch tips from a JSON or `.md` instead of hard-coded
